#Bradford meeting
##16/08/2016

###Attendees:
+ Mark Anslow - Interim Head of Early Help
+ Cat Moss - Intelligence Officer (Children's Social Care & Families First)

Access database
Referrals upload - not enough cases

Use fuzzy matches to get enough

Need to get 3,100 by March - currently 1,200, 180 PBR

####Identifying new families
#####Education
LCS Liquid Logic - new module by end of the year

Capita One - weekly attendance push from most schools/academies

Problem with Out of Authority children

Academies - just a few that don't play ball

#####Crime
Use disposal data

Don't use ASB events, use ASB interventions

Refreshed on request - generally every 3 months

#####DV/Social Care
Contact, not referrals

#####Unemployment
DWP feed

###Key issues
+ Automation of data feeds
+ Tracking of families
+ Hotspots - geography etc.
+ Financial planning modelling - forecast
+ Historical claiming of PBR
+ Identifying potential new families - 10 new family support teams should help with this

####Immediate thoughts
Automating Access database?

Improving processes, not systems per se

Cases open > certain time *(don't know what I meant by this)*
