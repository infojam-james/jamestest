#Proposal for providing support to Bradford Families First
##Date: Thu, 29th September 2016

###Key issues

####The service is not getting enough 'quick win' referrals
Certain criteria - e.g. marginal school attendance - should be relatively easy to claim greater numbers of PBR for.  It is the 'gut feeling' of Cat and Derek that these 'low-hanging fruit' should be yielding greater numbers of claims than at present.  </br>


####Not enough time for managers to process referrals
While the service seeks greater numbers of referrals, there is currently a 'bottleneck' with the managers, whereby they struggle to process (allocate to key workers) large numbers of referrals in a timely manner, resulting in a sometimes-significant time lag before working with a family begins; during that time lag, of course, the families' circumstances might change significantly.</br>

####Not enough intelligence relating to families for which it has not been possible to claim PBR
This is something that Cat does not have the time at present to address.  However, she feels that better quality analysis of such families would yield immediate gains by identifying families that are 'practically there', thus allowing for a final 'push' to get them over a threshold, or to make a case for PBR after review on a pragmatic and common-sense basis.  It would also add significant value through the identifying of trends in where these barriers appear to exist.</br>

###Recommended support focus'

An analysis of, their data and data scrutiny processes, with the aim of boosting the instances of cases of this nature.

an analysis of, and solution to, the requirement to reduce the time required at this stage of the process </br>

developing a data model to be used with an appropriate data visualisation tool for the purposes of implementing a high-quality data analysis solution
