#Support Arrangements proposal to Families First, Bradford Metropolitan District Council
##Friday, 30th September 2016

###Introduction
This document outlines the proposed framework and objectives for providing support to Bradford MDCs Families First programme.

###Proposed Framework
At the outset, Infojam would provide one person to be on-site in Bradford for two days a week, at a rate of Â£250 per day.  The exact days will be agreed the previous week on a rolling basis, and thus may vary.  

This individual would be remotely supported by other members of the Infojam team.  This arrangement will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it continues to provide the requisite added-value.

###Key issues

Following an initial meeting on 16th August, a more detailed exploratory visit was conducted by James Woodward on 29th September.  The following broad issues were identified by James as a result of his conversations with various Families First team members, princple among them being Cat Moss:

####The service is not getting enough 'quick win' referrals
Certain criteria - e.g. marginal school attendance - should be relatively easy to claim greater numbers of PBR for.  It is the 'gut feeling' of the FF team that these 'low-hanging fruit' should be yielding greater numbers of claims than at present.  </br>

####Not enough time for managers to process referrals
While the service seeks greater numbers of referrals, FF managers struggle to process (allocate to lead practitioners) large numbers of referrals in a timely manner, resulting in a sometimes-significant time lag before working with a family begins; during that time lag, the families' circumstances might change, and opportunities for claiming PBR may be missed.</br>

####Not enough intelligence relating to families for which it has not been possible to claim PBR
This is something that Cat does not have capacity to address at present.  However, she feels that better quality analysis of such families would yield immediate gains by identifying families that are 'practically there', thus allowing for a final 'push' to get them over a threshold, or to make a case for PBR after review on a pragmatic and common-sense basis.  It would also add significant value through the identifying of trends in where these barriers appear to exist.</br>


###Proposed focus of initial support

As a result of the above issues, it is proposed that the following provide the initial focus for the support:

1. Analysis of the current business situation </br>
This would use a blend of business analysis techniques to get a picture of how things *are*.  Part of this analysis would be to develop a consensus on how stakeholder believe the business system *should be*.  This is often highly beneficial for revealing where improvements - be they technical or process-driven - need to be made, by getting to the root cause of things such as handover delays and bottlenecks.

2. Develop an analysis data model </br>
This would begin with developing a more detailed knowledge of the various data streams feeding into the programme.  Not only is this crucial for understanding the business system in general, but initially would be for the specific purpose of arriving at a sustainable data model that can be fed into an appropriate analysis visualisation tool for the purposes of developing meaningful business intelligence.

While the aim of these recommendations is to provide added value to the service as quickly as possible, it may well prove just the jumping-off point for other areas once the business situation is understood in more detail.


###Data Sharing and Confidentiality
Infojam Limited and all its employees agree to abide by Bradford MDCs standard data-sharing and confidentality agreements for contractors.  In the event the support being provided by the wider Infojam team requires data to be sent outside the Council's network, it is proposed that such data be anonymised as standard before transmission, and only sent via secure email or similarly secure method.

###Technical Requirements
Infojam will need to access the Bradford MDC network.  Due to the 'hot desking' arrangements in place, and potentially mobile nature of the role, it would be preferable if a Bradford MDC laptop were to be made available for the duration of the contract.  If a laptop is unable to be released, Infojam would propose using its own laptop to access the Council network via a VPN local installation.  It would be necessary to liaise with Bradford IT department to facilitate this.
