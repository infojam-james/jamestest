#Proposal for providing support to Bradford Families First
##Date: Thu, 29th September 2016

###Key issues

####The service is not getting enough 'quick win' referrals
Certain criteria - e.g. marginal school attendance - should be relatively easy to claim greater numbers of PBR for.  It is the 'gut feeling' of Cat and Derek that these 'low-hanging fruit' should be yielding greater numbers of claims than at present.  </br>

####Not enough time for managers to process referrals
While the service seeks greater numbers of referrals, FF managers struggle to process (allocate to lead practitioners) large numbers of referrals in a timely manner, resulting in a sometimes-significant time lag before working with a family begins; during that time lag, the families' circumstances might change, and opportunities for claiming PBR may be missed.</br>

####Not enough intelligence relating to families for which it has not been possible to claim PBR
This is something that Cat does not have capacity to address at present.  However, she feels that better quality analysis of such families would yield immediate gains by identifying families that are 'practically there', thus allowing for a final 'push' to get them over a threshold, or to make a case for PBR after review on a pragmatic and common-sense basis.  It would also add significant value through the identifying of trends in where these barriers appear to exist.</br>

###Proposed focus of initial support

1. Analysis of the current business situation </br>
This would use a blend of business analysis techniques to get a picture of how things *are*.  Part of this analysis would be to develop a consensus on how stakeholder believe the business system *should* be.  This is often highly beneficial for revealing where improvements - be they technical or process-driven - need to be made, by getting to the root cause of things such as handover delays and bottlenecks.

2. Develop an analysis data model 
to allow for to be used with an appropriate data visualisation tool for the purposes of implementing a high-quality data analysis solution
