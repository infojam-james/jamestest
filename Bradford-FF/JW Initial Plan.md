##Reminder of key problems/issues for exploration:
+ Not enough 'Quick Win' referrals
+ Not enough time for managers to process referrals
+ Not enough intelligence on families PBR was *not* able to be claimed for

##Analysis of the current business situation

**1. Get an organisation chart**</br>
One with names and roles.  If no such chart exists, create one!

**2. Use the organisation chart to help identify key people I need to meet**</br>
Discuss with Cat the potential difficulties of doing that.  Ensure that personnel in both Tactical (e.g. middle management) and Operational roles are identified.

**3. Contact identified people**</br>
In person if possible, otherwise by phone, email is last resort.
Say hello, ask for a convenient time to meet

**4. Meetings will ideally be either:**</br>
+ A single meeting/interview, last no more than 1 hour</br>
This is preferable for Tactical personnel
OR</br>
+ Short interview, followed by protocol analysis with activity and/or document sampling
Either of these options may be suitable for Operational personnel

*4.1 Full meeting/interview*
The purpose of such meetings is to:</br>
+ Identify CSFs, KPIs and reporting requirements (T)
+ Identify current situations and processes (OP)

*4.2 Protocol analysis*
The purpose of protocol analysis is to observe the individual carrying out task, describing each step as they perfor it,
This may well include:</br>
+ Activity Sampling</br>
Quantative measurement of time spent on specific tasks/aspects of the process.
+ Document Sampling</br>
Examples of forms/documents used

**5. Summarise and coalesce**
+ 5.1 Each person's interview/sampling should be written up immediately/ASAP afterwards.
+ 5.2 Where appropriate, make a rich picture or mind map
+ 5.3 Convert these into a Business Activity Model for each perspective
+ 5.4 Use individual BAMs to create consensus BAM.  Remember that BAMs illustrate the process *as it should be, not necessarily as it is*
+ Perform gap analysis between the 'as is' and 'should be' situation
