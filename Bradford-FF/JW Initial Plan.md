**1. Get an organisation chart**</br>
One with names and roles.  If no such chart exists, create one!

**2. Use the organisation chart to help identify key people I need to meet**</br>
Discuss with Cat the potential difficulties of doing that

**3. Contact identified people**</br>
In person if possible, otherwise by phone, email is last resort.
Say hello, ask for a convenient time to meet

**4. Meetings will ideally be either:**</br>
+ A single meeting/interview, last no more than 1 hour</br>
OR</br>
+ Short interview, followed by protocol analysis with activity & document sampling

*4.1 Full meeting/interview*
