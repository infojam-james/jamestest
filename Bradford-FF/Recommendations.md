##Consultancy on Families First Project
###Last updated: 4th November 2016

##Background
[general background goes here]

[overview of team structure goes here]

Families First is currently part of the pilot scheme of a proposed Early Help Service.  This will be a devolved service comprising several related, currently standalone, services.  The pilot scheme is geographically structured - the constituency of Keighley, and the postcode areas BD3, BD4 and BD5 are included in it.  As FF Manager also work on a geographical basis, only the manager for those areas is directly involved in the pilot at this stage.

##Use the implementation of the Early Help Gateway to develop more robust processes around referrals and triage

At present there is no process, and therefore no data, around the routes from/to referrals.  The following information has been relayed anecdotally by various members of the FF team:

+ "Hardly any referrals come from Housing."
+ "Alot of schools don't even know who Families First is."
+ "However, those schools who do know about us give us a good number of referrals."
+ "40-50% of referral forms get returned because they are incomplete or inaccurate."

While it is logical to assume that many of the cases being missed due to these referral route 'gaps' are being identified in other ways through other services, it is equally logical to assume that this is not always the case; it is the view of at least on FF team member that referrals would increase through 'filling in these blind spots'.  However, short of trawling through hundreds of individual emails dating back to 2014, there is no way of gathering the quantative evidence to substantiate or refute any of these claims.  This in turn makes it difficult to justify any resources required to improve engagement.

As the FF service has no 'public' face (to front line services), this seems, at least in part, to have created a Catch-22 situation: front line services need to already know about Families First in order to make a referral for the first time, yet only those services that have made a referral in the past seem to know about Families First. - *hopefully remedied by the new Early Help Gateway

###Recommendations
**1 Implement new process for accessing and completing referral forms, in the process ensuring the capture of referral route data**
####Options
+ New Spreadsheet
This would be simple in nature, but would insert an additional step for administrators to complete in what is already a process with many steps.
+ Additional field to Phase 2 database
Given that the FF team in general lacks confidence in the 'ChildView' system
+ Intranet page with online form.  Online form has sufficient validation to ensure that all mandatory fields are completed.  Once submitted, form is sent to both FF Admin mailbox and referrer email.  

###Summary of issues
The principle format for documentation is MS Word and MS Excel documents.  There are several of these, including:

+ 2 Word documents for every referral (a completed Referral Form and an Additional Information form for identifying criteria).  The additional information form contains some quantative data (school attendance), but mostly provides space for comments.  The form does not prompt for an explicit judgment on whether the referral meets any of the 6 criteria, and there is no recording at this stage which criteria have been completed and which have not.

+ An Allocation Form for each FF Manager (Excel).  This is generally considered to be an exercise in duplication by the administrators that are responsibile for completing it.

+ A tracking sheet (Word) for administrators to help "keeping their sanity" by keeping track of the referral's status.

+ A ticksheet (Excel, usually printed) for administrators, to help ensure they complete all required tasks

Despite the referrals process consisting of multiple manual checks, there is no single source of the following key information:
+ Whether a referral has previously been claimed for (currently list derived from Phase 2 database, but only updated periodically)
+ Whether a referral is currently in the programme (live Phase 2)

This is partly down to the unreliable nature of the information held in ChildView.

##Expedite the replacement of ChildView

ChildView is the case management system currently in situ.  It is being replaced with LiquidLogic LCS, however no timescale on this has been relayed to the Families First team.  A 3-day training session was abandoned  half-way through day 1 when it became apparent that the delegate profile was one with wildly varying needs, needs that the trainer had been inadequately prepared for.

Key issues with ChildView are:
+ Data held is not trusted - checking information on ChildView, as a general rule, gets corroborated by data from other sources (e.g. Phase 2 database, Liquid Logic)
+ ChildView's shortcomings have created multiple 'workaround' processes' - related to the previous point, the ongoing requirement to use it creates duplication in data and process terms.  To quote on FF team member, "ChildView has become a recording system, *not* a monitoring system."
+ Documents cannot be uploaded to the system if it being accessed remotely (e.g. when working from home)

##Introduce a robust process for conducting triage against Health criteria

There is currently no process for measuring a referral against health criteria.  The Health team that was part of the service was removed in 2014.  Since then, unless a referral has specifically come via a health-related route (and while triage processes against other criteria do often 'pick up' information related to mental health, it is very common that checks against health criteria are not completed, if they are carried out at all.  



##Review cut-off periods and review process for tiered interventions

+ Tier 1 (approx 55-60% of all interventions): 12-16 weeks
+ Tier 2 (approx 30-35%): 6 months
+ Tier 3 (approx 10%): 9 months

When these time limits are reached, the case status is changed to 'Closed' on the Phase 2 database, whether or not a PBR claim can be made.  The purpose of this is to impose a practical limit on intervention length, against which progress can be gauged.  However, in many cases work continues with these families, particularly in the case of Tier 3s.  This may account, at least in part, for the seemingly large number of cases that are 'Closed' but for which PBR has not been claimed.
