##Consultancy on Families First Project
###Last updated: 4th November 2016

##Background
The Families First.

Families First is currently participating in the pilot scheme of a proposed Early Help Service.  This will be  the introduction of , along with the Early Help Gateway

##Use the implementation of the Early Help Gateway to develop more robust processes around referrals and triage

At present there is no process, and therefore no information, around the routes from/to referrals.  The following information has been relayed anecdotally by various members of the FF team:

+ "Hardly any referrals come from Housing."
+ "Alot of schools don't even know who Families First is."
+ "However, those schools who do know about us give us a good number of referrals."
+ "40-50% of referral forms get returned because they are incomplete or inaccurate."

While it is logical to assume that many of the cases being missed due to these referral route 'gaps' are being identified in other ways through other services, it is equally logical to assume that this is not always the case; it is the view of at least on FF team member that referrals would increase through 'filling in these blind spots'.  However, short of trawling through hundreds of individual emails dating back to 2014, there is no way of gathering the quantative evidence to substantiate or refute any of these claims.  This in turn makes it difficult to justify any resources required to improve engagement.

As the FF service has no 'public' face (to front line services), this seems, at least in part, to have created a Catch-22 situation: front line services need to already know about Families First in order to make a referral for the first time, yet only those services that have made a referral in the past seem to know about Families First. - *hopefully remedied by the new Early Help Gateway

###Recommendations
**1 Design and implement a process for capturing referral route data**
####Options
+ New Spreadsheet
This would be simple in nature, but would insert an additional step for administrators to complete in what is already a process with many steps.
+ Additional field to Phase 2 database
Given that the FF team in general lacks confidence in the 'ChildView' system

**2 Improve process for accessing, and completing referral forms right first time**
####Options
+ Intranet page with online form.  Online form has sufficient validation to ensure that all mandatory fields are completed.  Once submitted, form is sent to both FF Admin mailbox and referrer email.  


###Summary of issues
The principle format for documentation is MS Word and MS Excel documents.  There are many of these, including:

**2 Word documents for every referral**
Each week, a new folder is created on the K Drive following the naming convention 'Received Week Beginning [DD.MM.YYYY]'.  Inside this folder are sub-folders named after each consistuency.  Inside these folders are placed:
+ the completed **Referral Form** for each new referrals residing in this consistuency
+ An **Additional Information form** for this referral
The additional information form contains some quantative data (school attendance), but mostly provides space for comments.  The form does not prompt for an explicit judgment on whether the referral meets any of the 6 criteria, and there is no tracking of which criteria have been completed and which have not.

Presently the referrals process consists of multiple manual checks.  There is no single source of the following key information:
+ Whether a referral has previously been claimed for (currently list derived from Phase 2 database, but only updated periodically)
+ Whether a referral is currently in the programme (live Phase 2)

##Expedite the replacement of ChildView

ChildView is the case management system currently in situ.  It is being replaced with LiquidLogic LCS, however no timescale on this has been relayed to the Families First team.  A 3-day training session was abandoned  half-way through day 1 when it became apparent that the delegate profile was one with wildly varying needs, needs that the trainer had been inadequately prepared for.

Key issues with ChildView are:
+ Data held is not trusted - checking information on ChildView, as a general rule, gets corroborated by data from other sources (e.g. Phase 2 database, Liquid Logic)
+ ChildView's shortcomings have created multiple 'workaround' processes' - related to the previous point, the ongoing requirement to use it creates duplication in data and process terms.  To quote on FF team member, "ChildView has become a recording system, *not* a monitoring system."
+ Documents cannot be uploaded to the system if it being accessed remotely (e.g. when working from home)

##Introduce a robust process for conducting triage against Health criteria

##Review cut-off periods and review process for tiered interventions

+ Tier 1 (approx 55-60% of all interventions): 12-16 weeks
+ Tier 2 (approx 30-35%): 6 months
+ Tier 3 (approx 10%): 9 months

When these time limits are reached, the case status is changed to 'Closed' on the Phase 2 database, whether or not a PBR claim can be made.  The purpose of this is to impose a practical limit on intervention length, against which progress can be gauged.  However, in many cases work continues with these families, particularly in the case of Tier 3s.  This may account, at least in part, for the seemingly large number of cases that are 'Closed' but for which PBR has not been claimed.
