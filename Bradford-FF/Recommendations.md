##Recommendation: streamlining of referrals/triage process

###Summary of issues
Presently the referrals process consists of multiple manual checks.  There is no single source of the following key information:
+ Whether a referral has previously been claimed for (currently list derived from Phase 2 database, but only updated periodically)
+ Whether a referral is currently in the programme (live Phase 2)

###Targeted benefits:
+ Reduced duplication for FF Admin
+ Reduced burden on Admin to provide notifications
+ Time compression between receipt of referral and allocation
