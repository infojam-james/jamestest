##Recommendation: Develop an intelligent approach to engagement with front line services
At present there is no process, and therefore no information, around the routes from/to referrals.  The following information has been relayed anecdotally from various members of the FF team:

+ "Hardly any referrals come from Housing."
+ "Alot of schools don't even know who Families First is."
+ "40-50% of referral forms get returned because they are incomplete or inaccurate."

However, short of trawling through hundreds of individual emails, there is no way of gathering evidence to substantiate or refute any of these claims, which in turn makes it difficult to justify any resources required to identify where engagement might be improved.  The 

It is logical to assume that cases are being missed due to the gaps in these potential referral routes.  However, lack of intelligence around the referrals process.  A more pro-active approach to engagement of front-line services 




##Recommendation: streamlining of referrals/triage process

###Summary of issues
Presently the referrals process consists of multiple manual checks.  There is no single source of the following key information:
+ Whether a referral has previously been claimed for (currently list derived from Phase 2 database, but only updated periodically)
+ Whether a referral is currently in the programme (live Phase 2)

###Targeted benefits:
+ Reduced duplication for FF Admin
+ Reduced burden on Admin to provide notifications
+ Time compression between receipt of referral and allocation
