#Notes from meeting at Bradford Families First
##Date: Thu, 29th September 2016
##Venues: Margaret McMillan Tower, Sir Henry Mitchell House (both Bradford)

###Meeting Purpose:

+ To build upon the meeting of 16th August with a deeper exploration of the general situation at Bradford
+ More detail around the FF criteria that Bradford has defined
+ More detail around how their data is collected and handled
+ Identify key areas where data, systems and/or processes might be improved through assistance from Infojam

###People met:

+ Cat Moss - Intelligence Officer
+ Derek [surname tbc] - FF Manager for Early Help
+ Julie [surname tbc] - FF Administrator (n.b. the FF Admin Team consists of 4 people)

###Key issues/Recommendations

####The service is not getting enough 'quick win' referrals
Certain criteria - e.g. marginal school attendance - should be relatively easy to claim greater numbers of PBR for.  It is the 'gut feeling' of Cat and Derek that these 'low-hanging fruit' should be yielding greater numbers of claims than at present.  </br>

**Recommendation:** an analysis of, their data and data scrutiny processes, with the aim of boosting the instances of cases of this nature.

####Not enough time for managers to process referrals
While the service seeks greater numbers of referrals, there is currently a 'bottleneck' with the managers, whereby they struggle to process (allocate to key workers) large numbers of referrals in a timely manner, resulting in a sometimes-significant time lag before working with a family begins; during that time lag, of course, the families' circumstances might change significantly. </br>

**Recommendation:** an analysis of, and solution to, the requirement to reduce the time required at this stage of the process </br>
*I suspect this will end up being a systems-based solution, potentially adapting the Triage solution for Leeds.  However, this is not a fully-formed idea at this stage.*

####Not enough intelligence relating to families for which it has not been possible to claim PBR
This is something that Cat does not have the time at present to address.  However, she feels that better quality analysis of such families would yield immediate gains by identifying families that are 'practically there', thus allowing for a final 'push' to get them over a threshold, or to make a case for PBR after review on a pragmatic and common-sense basis.  It would also add significant value through the identifying of trends in where these barriers appear to exist.</br>

**Recommendation:** developing a data model to be used with an appropriate data visualisation tool for the purposes of implementing a high-quality data analysis solution
